# Future implmentation plans
Jotting down thoughts so I have them later.

1. An ecosystem of props that are aware of each other.  This would require some peer-to-peer or api logic. 
2. Easy setup for wifi  -- QR Code that can be generated by a phone maybe.
3. Active and Passive listening and vision modes
  - Threaded vs. Multithreaded puts this part of the way there, but I'm thinking more along the lines of "always on" with a buffer so if you speak and say a trigger word at the end, it can read the buffer and know what was said.
  - Active: Engaged in a conversation - similar behavior to current behavior
  - Passive: Waiting to be engaged, but buffering
4. Lights, servos, action
5.
