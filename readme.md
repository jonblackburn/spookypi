## Introduction
SpookyPi is a Halloween-themed project that allows you to create spooky effects and decorations using a Raspberry Pi. Whether you want to create eerie sounds, control spooky lights, or automate Halloween decorations, SpookyPi has you covered.

## Third Party Tools
To use SpookyPi, you need to have `mpv` and `ffmpeg` (for audio playback support) installed and available in your system's PATH. These tools are essential for handling audio playback.
- **mpv**: A free, open-source, and cross-platform media player.
- **ffmpeg**: A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert, and stream audio and video.

Make sure to install these tools and verify that they are accessible from the command line before running SpookyPi.
